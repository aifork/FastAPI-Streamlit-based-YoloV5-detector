# FastAPI-Streamlit-based-YoloV5-detector
Playing around with FastAPI and streamlit to create a YoloV5 object detector

It turns out that a User Interface improves the user satisfaction when they utilize deep learning models for experiments. This project of mine aims to do just that.
Even though a FastAPI, Streamlit based web app isnt a unique idea, I have however put my own twist by adding a section that accepts videos for bounding box annotation as well as images.
